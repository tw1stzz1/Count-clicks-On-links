# Bitly url shorterer

A project that allows you to shorten links using [bitly](https://dev.bitly.com) 

### How to install

The project needs a token to work. To get it, you need to register on the [official website] (https://bitly.com/pages/pricing), then get a token in the settings and put it in the env file.

Python3 should be already installed. 
Then use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes on online-course for web-developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org/).
